## Module maturity

Maturity levels: **Production** (stable, in daily use) · **Beta** (works, hardening)
· **Alpha** (functional, evolving) · **Planned** (not built).

| Module | Status |
|---|---|
| CRM | Production |
| Sales | Production |
| Hotels | Beta |
| Flights | Beta |
| Accounting | Planned |
| AI | Alpha |
| Supplier Portal | Planned |

> **Flights/Hotels nuance:** live *search* is shipped for both (Duffel + Hotelbeds);
> the maturity above reflects the end-to-end **booking** flow — Hotels is further
> along (Beta), real Flights booking is Planned (Duffel orders). See
> [api-integrations.md](api-integrations.md) and Open item #1.

## Active initiative — UI redesign (phased)

Bringing the **live app** up to the marketing-grade standard set by the sales deck
and mockups under `marketing/`. A full visual/UX upgrade of every screen, shipped
by phase, **preserving all functionality**. See the plan at
[specs/ui-redesign/PLAN.md](../specs/ui-redesign/PLAN.md) and the decision at
[docs/decisions/0005-app-ui-redesign.md](decisions/0005-app-ui-redesign.md).

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Design foundation (tokens + primitives) + seed full demo data | ✅ done |
| 1 | Dashboard · CRM (list + profile) · Pipeline | ✅ done |
| 2 | Proposal builder · Flight search · Hotel search | ✅ done |
| 3 | Bookings & Booking details · Finance · Commissions | ✅ done |
| 4 | Customer portal · Reports · AI assistant | ✅ done |
| 5 | Responsive, empty/loading/error states, polish | ⬜ next |

Marketing assets (deck + 11 mockups + demo dataset + design guide) live under
`marketing/` and are the visual target.

**Phase 1 delivery (command center).** Rebuilt Dashboard, CRM list + client
profile, and the Pipeline board to the mockup standard, reusing the Phase 0
primitives (StatCard deltas, insight charts) + three new shadcn primitives
(Tabs, Breadcrumb, Tooltip). **Delivery policy — redesign, not rewrite:** no
schema changes; any mockup field without a backing column is **derived from real
data** (lifetime value, trips, win rate, spend-by-year, MoM deltas, derived
follow-ups from balances/close-dates/passport alerts) or **omitted** — never
fabricated. Notable omissions (no backing data): client tags/loyalty/grade/
travel-preferences/Documents/Passport/Family tabs; opportunity reference ids and
per-stage micro-labels; the dashboard "Atlas suggests" AI card and free-text
tasks. This same derive-or-omit policy governs Phases 2–5.

**Phases 2–4 delivery (sell · operate · client experience).** Applied the command-
center system across the revenue, fulfilment, and client-facing surfaces, all
redesign-not-rewrite (no schema/logic changes; presentational + new-scaffold only):
- **Phase 2** — proposal builder (breadcrumb + sectioned card; line items got
  per-category colour tiles, per-line margin, a totals panel); flight search
  (airline logo tiles, elevated panel, loading skeleton, EmptyState); hotel search
  (same treatment). *Omitted:* the mockup's live proposal preview pane (net-new
  renderer — public `/p/[token]` view + server PDF already exist) and the flight
  sidebar-filter layout.
- **Phase 3** — bookings list KPI strip (counts only, no FX summing) + `loading.tsx`/
  `error.tsx`; booking-details (breadcrumb, derived KPI strip, card-elevated, finance
  hero with payment progress bar) via a map→plan→implement→verify workflow; finance
  (card-elevated charts/AR, EmptyState, row hover) + commissions (elevated table).
- **Phase 4** — customer portal (elevated/interactive cards, EmptyStates, balance
  hero) via a 4-page parallel workflow; reports export hub (per-dataset icon tiles);
  AI assistant (brand Bot tile, role icons, shadcn Input).
- **Verification:** build-gated (lint + tsc) on every commit; the heavier screens
  ran adversarial multi-agent review (regression + design + policy lenses) — which
  caught and fixed a real client-facing regression in the portal (a negative balance
  could be shown to a client). Visual/browser QA is still pending (local dev DB has
  no seeded user; signup is invite-only).
- **Docs:** DESIGN.md gained the amber "warning / amount-due" status colour (was
  undocumented despite wide use). i18n of new English labels on deeper pages is
  tracked under open-item #2 (translate deeper pages), consistent with those pages'
  pre-existing hardcoded strings.

## Open items

1. **Real supplier booking** — ✅ architecture complete (Sprint 1 Waves 1–3). Provider
   registry, quote→book→cancel lifecycle, idempotency, event log, and supplier-ref
   tables are all wired. Activate by setting `DUFFEL_API_TOKEN` (flights) and
   `HOTELBEDS_API_KEY`/`HOTELBEDS_SECRET` + `ATLAS_ENV=production` (hotels).
2. **Translate deeper pages** — bookings, clients, finance, support, platform
   (i18n plumbing ready).
3. **Cross-device locale** — sync `user.locale` → cookie on login.
4. **WhatsApp integration** — Meta Cloud API adapter (skeleton ready; Meta
   Business account needed).
5. **Automated quotations** — trigger quote generation from opportunity stage
   change.
6. **Agent performance scoring** — leaderboard from commission + booking counts.
7. **Convert proposal to booking guard** — add `convertedBookingId` column (needs
   migration).

### Known issues (non-blocking)

- **Topbar hydration warning (dev-only).** A React 19 + Radix `useId` mismatch logs
  on the topbar menus (`AppShell` → `Topbar` dropdowns) in the dev console. **Benign:**
  React recovers automatically, every menu/theme/nav works, and it does not surface in
  the production build. Root-caused as far as reasonable: the mobile `Sheet` (the only
  `useId` consumer before the topbar) was proven *not* responsible — the mismatch is
  byte-identical even with the Sheet absent during hydration — and the root providers
  already set `suppressHydrationWarning`. It appears to be a React streaming/Suspense ×
  Radix `useId` interaction; most likely resolved by a future Radix/Next minor bump.
  **Do not** re-chase via app-code edits to the shell (already attempted; no fix, and it
  risks the verified-working chrome). Related: `docs/decisions/0005-app-ui-redesign.md`.

## Planned modules

The longer-horizon module backlog, grouped. Some already have partial foundations
(noted) — the rest are net-new.

**Accounting**
- Accounting · General Ledger · Payroll — net-new finance suite.
- Invoices — ⚠️ on-demand invoice PDFs exist today; this is the move to managed,
  numbered, ledgered invoices.

**Marketing**
- Marketing · Email campaigns — net-new (transactional email via Resend exists;
  campaigns do not).
- WhatsApp — ⚠️ adapter skeleton ready (open item #4); needs a Meta Business account.
- SMS — net-new channel adapter.

**Documents**
- Document management — net-new (today: PDF generation + Vercel Blob uploads for
  supplier contracts).

**Travel products**
- eVisa · Visa tracking — ⚠️ an AI visa assistant exists; these add structured
  application + tracking.
- Insurance — ⚠️ exists as a trip-service item type; this is a managed insurance
  product/flow.
- Vehicle rental · Cruises — net-new verticals (alongside flights/hotels).
- Package builder — net-new (bundle multi-service trips).

**Ecosystem**
- Supplier portal — net-new (suppliers self-serve, parallel to the client portal).
- Customer loyalty · Affiliate program — net-new growth modules.
- API marketplace — net-new (expose/consume third-party integrations).

> These are directional, not scheduled. Phase status and the active gap list are
> above; this is the "what's next after the core is hardened" backlog.

## Spec vs. reality gap tracker

The design system (principles, never-rules, page/table/entity standards, AI
guardrails, automation triggers, perf budgets) describes a **target state**. This
table consolidates every item where the spec is ahead of the code, so the gaps are
one punch list instead of scattered "current state" notes.

Status: ✅ done · 🟡 partial · 🔴 not started

| Item | Spec | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent visibility scoped to own records on list pages | [security](security.md) | ✅ | Fixed — clients/bookings/opportunities/products now scope by owner column (commit `134ceb3`). |
| Quality gate `npm run check` works (pnpm v11) | [development-guide](development-guide.md) | ✅ | Fixed — config moved to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; 0 lint/type errors (commit `7d5f4e1`). |
| Soft delete (`deletedAt`, filtered reads) | [database](database.md#entity-standard) | 🔴 | No soft-delete column anywhere; "never hard delete" is currently aspirational. Needs migration. |
| `reference` on all entities | [database](database.md#entity-standard) | 🟡 | Only `booking` + `product`; missing on clients/opportunities/suppliers. Needs migration. |
| Consistent `updatedAt`/`status`/`notes` on children | [database](database.md#entity-standard) | 🟡 | Present on roots, inconsistent on child tables. |
| Page systemic-five: per-page **Export** | [ui-ux](ui-ux.md#page-requirements-checklist) | 🔴 | Endpoint exists (`/api/export`); list pages lack buttons. |
| Page systemic-five: **Bulk actions** | [ui-ux](ui-ux.md#page-requirements-checklist) | 🔴 | No `Checkbox` primitive exists; nothing built. |
| Page systemic-five: **Loading** states | [ui-ux](ui-ux.md#page-requirements-checklist) | 🔴 | Only `assistant`/`dashboard` have `loading.tsx`. `skeleton.tsx` exists, unused. |
| Page systemic-five: **Error** states | [ui-ux](ui-ux.md#page-requirements-checklist) | 🔴 | Only `assistant` has `error.tsx`. |
| Page systemic-five: **Pagination** | [ui-ux](ui-ux.md#page-requirements-checklist) | 🔴 | Hardcoded `limit` (200/500) silently truncates. |
| Shared **DataTable** (sort, filter, column chooser, infinite scroll, sticky header, shortcuts, context menu) | [ui-ux](ui-ux.md#data-table-standard) | 🔴 | Tables are plain shadcn markup. Building this clears most of the systemic-five. |
| Mobile-friendly tables (`overflow-x-auto`) | [ui-ux](ui-ux.md#atlas-design-principles) | 🔴 | Tables overflow on phones; only `assistant` wraps for scroll. |
| Automation triggers (welcome email, won→proposal, accepted→booking, confirmed→invoice, completed→review) | [business-rules](business-rules.md#automation-triggers) | 🟡 | Only commission auto-gen on confirm/ticket fires; rest manual/on-demand. |
| AI mutation behind a hard confirm step | [ai](ai.md#ai-must-never) | 🔴 | `createBooking` is intent-gated by prompt only, not an enforced confirm gate. |
| Performance instrumentation vs budgets | [ui-ux](ui-ux.md#performance-budgets) | 🔴 | Budgets defined; nothing measured. |
| Real supplier booking (Duffel orders, Hotelbeds book) | [api-integrations](api-integrations.md) | ✅ | Architecture complete (Sprint 1 + 2). Activate with production credentials (see open item #1). |
| Cross-device locale sync | [architecture](architecture.md#internationalization) | 🔴 | English until re-pick on a fresh device (also open item #3 above). |
| Rate limiting (auth + API) | [security](security.md#security-controls) | 🔴 | No throttling anywhere. |
| GDPR subject export/erasure + consent | [security](security.md#security-controls) | 🔴 | No flow; erasure also blocked by missing soft delete. |
| Disaster recovery runbook + RTO/RPO | [security](security.md#security-controls) | 🔴 | Neon has provider backups; no documented DR plan. |
| Universal audit-log coverage | [security](security.md#security-controls) · [coding-standards](coding-standards.md#engineering-rules) | 🟡 | `logActivity` in ~11/21 action files; not all mutations logged. |
| Universal Zod input validation | [coding-standards](coding-standards.md#engineering-rules) | 🟡 | Zod in ~13/21 action files; not every action validates. |
| `activity_log` partitioning + retention (500M-row target) | [architecture](architecture.md#scale-targets) | 🔴 | Single unpartitioned table; no archival. |
| Search concurrency/backpressure (100 concurrent) | [architecture](architecture.md#scale-targets) | 🔴 | No queue or rate control on hotel/flight search. |
